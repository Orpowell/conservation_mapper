The following repository contains script and analysis that contributed to:

A Wheat Tandem Kinase Sensor Activates an NLR Helper to Trigger Immunity (Chen et. al 2024)

Each directory pertains to a specific piece of analysis:

- BSA_analysis: Analysis of the BC1F2 susceptible families of NLR mutants shown in Figure 2D.
- conservation_mapping: A pymol script for mapping conserved residues from multiple sequence alignments onto pymol structures. This was used extensively in Figure 4B-D.
